# Unity3d support

The primary purpose of this library is to be able to interact with Unity3d scene files, prefabs and GameObjects outside of the scope of the Unity3d editor.

This also means making proxies for common Unity3d elements like GameObject, Component, Transform, etc.

This library is primarily used to create `.lap` files. These are like `.limapp` files, but better in all respects.

## Version Support

The `Pyro.Unity3d` library supports *Unity3d* version 2019+.
