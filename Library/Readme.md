# All Libraries used by the system

Each library has its own `Readme.md`.

Libraries are built to `/Bin` and copied to `Unity3d/DiverProject/Assets/Liminal/Assemblies`.

To be able to debug into the libraries from within the *Unity3d* app, run `conv.bat` from within the `Assemblies` folder. This converts the `.pdb` files generated by *Visual Studio* to `.mdp` files used by *Mono*. 

This will all be automated later.
