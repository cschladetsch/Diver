# Unity3d

Unity3d-specific projects. These use projects built by the parent solution.

* `DiverProject`. The main app that utilitises all the Diver assemblies.

Note that you cannot build the `DiverProject` from the main Solution. It has to be built as usual from within Unity3d itself. It's only added to the top-level Solution so we can access the source readily without loading the Unity3d project.
