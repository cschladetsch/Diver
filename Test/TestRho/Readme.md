# Rho Tests

Rho is an in-fix language that looks a lot like Python.

* Translates to *Pi* code and is run on the same type of `Executor`.
* Supports native continuations and parameterised functions.
* *Rho* is much more human-readable than *Pi*, but it takes longer to parse and execute. Think of Pi like asm and Rho like C/C++ (but with only duck typing)
